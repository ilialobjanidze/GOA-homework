This is the default position of an element.
relative
The element is positioned relative to its normal position 
and then adjusted based on the top, right, bottom, or left values.
fixed
The element is positioned relative to the browser window and will not move when the page is scrolled.
sticky
 The element is treated as relative until 
it reaches a specified scroll position, at which point it becomes fixed.-->
