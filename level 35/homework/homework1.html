<!-- static - the element is positioned with normal flow of the document.
 and it does not respond to top, bottom, left, or right properties.-->
 <!--relative - The element is positioned to its normal position.
The space it would normally occupy isnt occupied anymore
You can use top, bottom, left, and right properties to move it.-->

<!--fixed - It stays in the same place even if you scroll the page.-->

<!--sticky - The element behaves like relative until it becomes fixed as you scroll past it.-->
