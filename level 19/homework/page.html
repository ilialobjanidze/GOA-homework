            I love football, in fact i was footballer for nearly 4 years but i had a Osgood-Schlatter in mu left knee, so i had to find another <br>
            hobby but as you can see i am here, studying programming. in my early years i wanted to become football player but one day my mate told me about <br>
            programming, well i pretty much spent all my free time on computer, it wasnt really hard to adapt and learn programming because i was familliar <br>
            with computers and stuff. leaving football pitch doesnot mean i dont watch football at all, well in fact my favourite team is Bayern Munich <br>
            well known from their nickname <strong>RekordMeister</strong>my friend is barcelona's fan and we always fight about whos team is better. <br>
